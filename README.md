# Sissix

A local-storage/indexed-db based book tracking web app.

## Acknowledgement

Sissix is named after the amazing Aandrisk pilot of Becky Chambers' Wayfarers series, Sissix Seshkethet.

This wouldn't exist if it wasn't for that series, and my inability to remember which books of the series I do and don't have.
